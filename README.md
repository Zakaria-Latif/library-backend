## Make sure to setup MySQL for server

1. Install MySQL on your computer
2. Create database called `library_schema` that listens on port 3307
3. with the username `root` and no password. (You can change what these values are in the [application.properties](https://github.com/Zakaria-Latif/library-backend/blob/main/src/main/resources/application.properties))
